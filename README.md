I use this file to play around with the markdown format.
That is why I mark everything like **this** to enhance readability or like *this* when I want to emphasise the particular name. However, I you ever see me writing in ***this*** format, you know something is about to happen...

Now that we have established **italic**, *bold*, and ***bold-italic*** it is time to see what happens when I change a commited file.

## Subsection

In this section I will show the format of the Subsection.
